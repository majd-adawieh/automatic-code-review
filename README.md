The main idea is to use RL algorithms on the abstract sytnax tree generated on python code
Each code block is an episode.
The agent should find out if the code is ok or not.

### Problems:
1. Most of the inputs are strings, how to encode them
2. How to represent the states.
3. how to enable the agent to memorize previous states
